# Refresh Button Implementation

## Overview
Added a refresh button to the "Live data" indicator pill that allows users to refresh data for individual locations without refreshing the entire page.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Refresh Button in Data Source Indicator
- **Location**: Located in the data source indicator pill (shows "Live Data", "Cached Data", etc.)
- **Icon**: Uses ðŸ”„ emoji as refresh icon
- **Styling**: Matches the color scheme of the indicator pill
- **Hover Effects**: Button becomes more opaque and shows background color on hover
- **Accessibility**: Includes proper title attribute for screen readers

### 2. Per-Location Refresh Functionality
- **Targeted Refresh**: Only refreshes data for the specific location clicked
- **Cache Clearing**: Clears cache entry for the specific location and date before fetching
- **Fresh Data**: Forces a fresh API call to get the latest data
- **State Management**: Updates only the specific location's data in the app state

### 3. Loading State Management
- **Visual Feedback**: Refresh button spins during loading
- **Disabled State**: Button is disabled and shows "not-allowed" cursor during refresh
- **Prevent Multiple Requests**: Prevents multiple simultaneous refresh requests for the same location
- **Loading Tracking**: Uses `refreshingLocations` Set to track which locations are currently refreshing

### 4. Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Errors during refresh are handled gracefully
- **Error Display**: Shows error message in the location card if refresh fails
- **Error Clearing**: Clears previous errors when starting a new refresh
- **Console Logging**: Logs refresh operations and errors for debugging

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

#### 1. `src/components/LocationCard.tsx`
- Added `onRefresh` and `isRefreshing` props to interface
- Added refresh button to data source indicator
- Implemented loading state styling and animations
- Added proper accessibility attributes

#### 2. `src/App.tsx`
- Added `refreshingLocations` state to track loading states
- Implemented `refreshLocationData` function for per-location refresh
- Added cache clearing before refresh using `removeCacheEntry`
- Added error handling and state management
- Passed refresh props to LocationCard components

### Key Functions

#### `refreshLocationData(locationName: string)`
```typescript
// Prevents multiple simultaneous refreshes
// Clears cache for specific location and date
// Fetches fresh data from API
// Updates location state with new data
// Handles errors gracefully
// Updates cache statistics
```

#### Refresh Button Component
```typescript
// Shows loading spinner when refreshing
// Disabled during refresh operations
// Proper hover states and accessibility
// Color-matched to indicator pill theme
```

## User Experience

### Visual Indicators
- **Idle State**: Semi-transparent refresh icon with hover effects
- **Loading State**: Spinning refresh icon, disabled button, reduced opacity
- **Success**: Updated data source indicator shows fresh timestamp
- **Error**: Error message displayed in location card

### Interaction Flow
1. User clicks refresh button in data source indicator
2. Button becomes disabled and starts spinning
3. Cache entry for location is cleared
4. Fresh data is fetched from API
5. Location card updates with new data
6. Button returns to idle state
7. Cache statistics are updated

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Granular Control**: Refresh individual locations instead of entire page
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of refresh status
- **Fresh Data**: Ensures latest weather and tide information
- **No Page Reload**: Smooth user experience without losing context

### For Performance
- **Targeted Updates**: Only refreshes necessary data
- **Cache Management**: Intelligent cache clearing for specific entries
- **Prevents Redundant Requests**: Blocks multiple simultaneous refreshes
- **Maintains Other Data**: Other locations remain unchanged

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- **Success Animation**: Brief success indicator when refresh completes
- **Retry Mechanism**: Automatic retry for failed refreshes
- **Refresh All Button**: Option to refresh all locations at once
- **Auto-refresh**: Configurable automatic refresh intervals
- **Offline Handling**: Better handling of offline scenarios

### Accessibility Enhancements
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for refresh button
- **Screen Reader Announcements**: Live region updates for refresh status
- **High Contrast**: Better visibility in high contrast modes
- **Focus Management**: Proper focus handling during refresh operations

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Load the application with cached data
2. Verify refresh button appears in data source indicators
3. Click refresh button and verify:
   - Button becomes disabled and spins
   - Fresh data is loaded
   - Data source indicator updates
   - Button returns to normal state
4. Test error scenarios (network issues)
5. Test multiple location refreshes
6. Verify accessibility with screen readers

### Automated Testing
- TypeScript compilation passes
- Component props are properly typed
- State management works correctly
- Error boundaries handle refresh errors

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- Works with both live API (`npm start`) and mock data (`npm run start:mock`)
- Respects existing cache configuration
- Uses existing weather service factory pattern

### Cache Behavior
- Clears specific cache entries before refresh
- Maintains cache statistics
- Works with localStorage cache implementation
- Supports fallback cache scenarios
