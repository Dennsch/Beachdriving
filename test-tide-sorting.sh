echo "ðŸ§ª Testing Tide Sorting Implementation"
echo "======================================"

echo ""
echo "ðŸ“‹ Implementation Summary:"
echo "- Modified LocationCard.tsx to sort tides chronologically"
echo "- Added robust error handling for invalid dates"
echo "- Uses immutable sorting (creates new array)"
echo "- Consistent with existing services (WillyWeatherService, SafetyService)"

echo ""
echo "âœ… Verification Completed:"
echo "- SafetyService: Already handles any tide order correctly"
echo "- WillyWeatherService: Already sorts tides chronologically"
echo "- MockDataService: Already provides sorted test data"
echo "- LocationCard: Now displays tides in chronological order"

echo ""
echo "ðŸŽ¯ Expected Behavior:"
echo "- Tides will display in time order (e.g., 6:00 AM Low, 12:00 PM High, 6:00 PM Low)"
echo "- Instead of grouping by type (all highs first, then all lows)"
echo "- More intuitive user experience with logical time sequence"

echo ""
echo "ðŸš€ To test the implementation:"
echo "1. Run 'npm start' for live API data"
echo "2. Run 'npm run start:mock' for mock data testing"
echo "3. Check that tides appear in chronological order on location cards"

echo "âœ¨ Implementation is complete and ready for testing!"
