# üèñÔ∏è Queensland Beach Driving Safety App

A React TypeScript application that helps determine safe beach driving conditions for popular Queensland beaches by analyzing tide data and weather conditions.

## Features

- **Real-time Safety Assessment**: Determines if it's safe to drive on the beach based on tide conditions
- **Multi-location Support**: Covers three popular Queensland beaches:
  - Bribie Island
  - Moreton Island  
  - North Stradbroke Island
- **Comprehensive Weather Data**: Displays temperature, rain probability, wind conditions, and more
- **Tide Information**: Shows high/low tide times and heights
- **Safe Driving Windows**: Calculates optimal time periods for beach driving
- **Date Selection**: View conditions for future dates (up to 7 days ahead)
- **Queensland Timezone**: All times displayed in Australian Eastern Time

## Safety Rules

The app follows the **2-hour rule**: Beach driving is considered unsafe within 2 hours before or after high tide, when sand conditions are typically softer and more dangerous.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Open in Browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## API Integration

This app integrates with the Willy Weather API to fetch:
- Current weather conditions
- Tide forecasts and timing
- Location-specific data

The API key is embedded in the application for the specified locations.

## Technology Stack

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **date-fns** for date/time manipulation
- **axios** for API requests
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox** for responsive layout
- **Willy Weather API** for weather and tide data

## Usage

1. **Current Conditions**: By default, the app shows current conditions for all three beaches
2. **Date Selection**: Use the date picker to view conditions for future dates
3. **Safety Status**: Each location card shows whether it's currently safe to drive
4. **Safe Windows**: View optimal driving times for the selected day
5. **Weather Details**: Check temperature, rain probability, and wind conditions
6. **Tide Times**: See high and low tide times and heights
