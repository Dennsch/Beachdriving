# Hurry Up Image Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented the "hurry up" functionality for the beach driving safety app. The app now shows a neutral image and warning message when it's between 3 hours and 2 hours before high tide.

## Changes Made

### 1. SafetyService.ts
- Added `HURRY_UP_HOURS_BEFORE_HIGH_TIDE = 3` constant
- Added `isHurryUpTime()` method to detect when current time is in the 3h-2h window before high tide
- Added `getSafetyStatus()` method that returns 'safe', 'hurry', or 'unsafe' status
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing `isSafeToDrive()` method

### 2. types.ts
- Extended `LocationData` interface to include `safetyStatus: 'safe' | 'hurry' | 'unsafe'` field
- Maintained existing `isSafe` boolean for backward compatibility

### 3. LocationCard.tsx
- Imported `NeutralImage` from "../images/Neutral.png"
- Updated destructuring to include `safetyStatus` from locationData
- Modified safety status rendering to handle three states:
  - Safe: Green positive image, "SAFE TO DRIVE"
  - Hurry: Yellow neutral image, "HURRY UP!", "It's getting late if you want to drive you need to hurry"
  - Unsafe: Red negative image, "UNSAFE TO DRIVE"
- Updated CSS classes to use 'neutral' class for hurry state

### 4. App.tsx
- Updated both `fetchAllLocationData()` and `refreshLocationData()` functions
- Added `safetyStatus` calculation using `safetyService.getSafetyStatus()`
- Included `safetyStatus` in LocationData objects
- Set error state to use 'unsafe' safetyStatus

### 5. App.css
- Added `.safety-status.neutral` CSS class with yellow/amber styling
- Used gradient background: `linear-gradient(135deg, #fff3cd 0%, #ffeaa7 100%)`
- Applied appropriate text color and border styling consistent with other states

## Functionality

### Three-State Safety System
1. **Safe** (Green): More than 3 hours before high tide or more than 2 hours after high tide
2. **Hurry** (Yellow/Neutral): Between 3 hours and 2 hours before high tide
3. **Unsafe** (Red): Within 2 hours before or after high tide

### Time Windows
- **Hurry Window**: 3h before high tide → 2h before high tide
- **Unsafe Window**: 2h before high tide → 2h after high tide
- **Safe Window**: All other times

### Message Display
When in "hurry" state, the app displays:
- Neutral/yellow image
- "HURRY UP!" as the main status
- "It's getting late if you want to drive you need to hurry" as the descriptive message

## Technical Details

### Logic Flow
1. `SafetyService.getSafetyStatus()` first checks if unsafe (within 2h of high tide)
2. If not unsafe, checks if in hurry window (3h-2h before high tide)
3. Otherwise returns safe status
4. This ensures proper priority: unsafe > hurry > safe

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing `isSafe` boolean field is maintained
- All existing functionality continues to work
- New `safetyStatus` field provides enhanced three-state information

### Visual Design
- Neutral state uses yellow/amber color scheme to indicate caution
- Consistent styling with existing safe/unsafe states
- Smooth transitions and hover effects maintained

## Testing
To test the implementation:
1. Run `npm start` to start the development server
2. Check that locations display appropriate status based on tide times
3. Verify that the neutral image appears during the 3h-2h window before high tide
4. Confirm the warning message displays correctly
5. Test that refresh functionality works with new safety states

## Files Modified
- `src/services/safetyService.ts`
- `src/types.ts`
- `src/components/LocationCard.tsx`
- `src/App.tsx`
- `src/App.css`

## Assets Used
- `src/images/Neutral.png` (existing asset)

The implementation successfully meets the requirements by showing the neutral image and appropriate warning message when it's between 3 hours and 2 hours before high tide, providing users with a clear indication that they should hurry if they want to drive on the beach.
